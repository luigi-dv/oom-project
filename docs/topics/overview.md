## Getting Started

To begin using the Quackstagram application, follow these simple steps:

<tabs>
    <tab title="Compile the Source Code">
        If the application's source code is not pre-compiled, you'll need to compile it using the following command:
        <code-block lang="bash"></code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Semantic markup">
        <code-block lang="xml">
            <![CDATA[<img src="new_topic_options.png" alt="Alt text" width="450px"/>]]></code-block>
    </tab>
</tabs>

### User Interface Overview
Apart from injecting entire XML elements, you can use attributes to configure the behavior of certain elements.
For example, you can collapse a chapter that contains non-essential information:

#### Supplementary info {collapsible="true"}
Content under a collapsible header will be collapsed by default,
but you can modify the behavior by adding the following attribute:
`default-state="expanded"`

### Functionality Guide
If you need to extend an element with more functions, you can convert selected content from Markdown to semantic markup.
For example, if you want to merge cells in a table, it's much easier to convert it to XML than do this in Markdown.
Position the caret anywhere in the table and press <shortcut>Alt+Enter</shortcut>:

<img src="convert_table_to_xml.png" alt="Convert table to XML" width="706" border-effect="line"/>
